The C++ examples are designed to be build from a command line (rather than an IDE like eclipse).

To build each example, simply enter that directory and type:

  make

To run each sample, simply enter that directory and type:

  make run

NOTE 1:  There is also a convenience Makefile in ~this~ directory that can make, clean and run all of the examples.

NOTE 2:  All C++ VMX-rtk examples are dependent upon the WPI and VMX-pi HAL libraries.  The paths to these libraries
should be configured via the setup_library_paths.sh script in the VMX RTK Examples root directory.
